# Clients

To begin working with the Paket API, Partners must first create a Client in the [Paket Developer Portal](https://developer.paket.tv). 

Clients are used by Platforms and Publishers, respectively, to communicate with the Paket API and to exchange data with other Clients. 

It is at the Client level that API credentials are issued, webhooks are delivered, and API products - such as TVaaS or Bundles - are configured.

Clients should correlate broadly to an operating system or platform, in the case of Platform accounts; or to an application, in the case of Publisher accounts.

A Platform such as Samsung might create a client for Tizen OS, whereas a Publisher such as Disney Streaming Services might create discrete Clients each for Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN.
